In this project you are required to create a system to manage all log-in related activities for users,
this system can be used in any other application to allow users to log-in and validate their
authentications. The system allows user to create accounts using sign up forms or use their
Facebook, Google or Twitter accounts to sign in, once they signed in, they can view and edit their
personal information. They can also see all their login history and the devices and locations they
signed in from. The system also should protect the user accounts by providing a feature to protect
their accounts, this feature is up to you to decide what you would like to implement. Finally, the
system should help the users retrieve their accounts in case they lost their login information.
